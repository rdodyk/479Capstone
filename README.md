# 479Capstone
A repository for the best CivE 479 capstone group, so that we can work on a great report together

## Using LaTeX
LaTeX is a really cool thing that makes formatting reports really easy. Adding equations, references, figures, etc is way simpler than word. [Find out how to use it here](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/)

## Using Git
Git is what we'll need to use if we want to use LaTeX and work together on this document. It might be a little weird at first, but I'll walk you through it. It's actually really easy and intuitive in the end. [Here's a command line tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) and [the graphical user interface tutorial](https://nathanj.github.io/gitguide/tour.html)

Hopefully these two things together will let us write a killer report that looks as good as it's written
