# 479Capstone
A repository for the best CivE 479 capstone group, so that we can work on a great report together

## Using LaTeX
LaTeX is a really cool thing that makes formatting reports really easy.
Adding equations, references, figures, etc is way simpler than word.
[Find out how to use it here](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/)

## Using the Bibliography
We can keep all of our references in the report.bib file.
If we keep all the
information there, we can easily reference all of our citations throughout our
report and also insert a perfectly formatted bibliography at the end of the
report.
Input the references in the following form:

@manual{abbreviation
AUTHOR = "Author"
TITLE = "Actual Title of the Reference"
PUBLISHER = {Whoever Published This}
ADDRESS = {Wherever it was published}
YEAR = 1111}

## Using Git
Git is what we'll need to use if we want to use LaTeX and work together on this document.
It might be a little weird at first, but I'll walk you through it.
It's actually really easy and intuitive in the end.
[Here's a command line tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) and [the graphical user interface tutorial](https://nathanj.github.io/gitguide/tour.html)

Hopefully these two things together will let us write a report with an
appearance that matches it's content.
